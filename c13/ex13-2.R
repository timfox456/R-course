# a. Obtain, rounded to two decimal places, the proportion of seis- mic events
# in the quakes data frame that occurred at a depth of 300 km or deeper.

# b. Remaining with the quakes data set, calculate the mean and median
# magnitudes of the events that occurred at a depth of 300 km or deeper

# c. Using the chickwts data set, write a for loop that gives you the mean
# weight of chicks for each feed type—the same as the results given by the
# tapply function in Section 13.2.1. Display the results rounded to one decimal
# place and, when printing, ensure each mean is labeled with the appropriate
# feed type.

# Another ready-to-use data set (in the automatically loaded datasets package)
# is InsectSprays. It contains data on the number of insects found on various
# agricultural units, as well as the type of insect spray that was used on each
# unit. Ensure you can access the data frame at the prompt; then study the help
# file ?InsectSprays to get an idea of R’s representation of the two variables.



# d. Identify the two variable types in InsectSprays (as per the defini- tions
# in Section 13.1.1 and Section 13.1.2).

# e. Calculate the modes of the distribution of insect counts, regard- less of
# spray type.

# f. Use tapply to report the total insect counts by each spray type.

# g. Using the same kind of for loop as in (c), compute the percent- age of
# agricultural units in each spray type group that had at least five bugs on
# them. When printing to the screen, round the percentages to the nearest whole
# number.

# h. Obtain the same numeric results as in (g), with rounding, but use tapply
# and a disposable function.
