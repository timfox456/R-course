# Exercise 2-5


# a. Convert the vector c(2,0.5,1,2,0.5,1,2,0.5,1) to a vector of only 1s, using a vector of length 3.


# b. The conversion from a temperature measurement in degrees Fahrenheit F to Celsius C is performed using the following equation:
#    C = 5/9  * (F - 32)
# Use vector-oriented behavior in R to convert the tempera- tures 45, 77, 20, 19, 101, 120, and 212 in degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius.


# c. Use the vector c(2,4,6) and the vector c(1,2) in conjunction with rep and * to produce the vector c(2,4,6,4,8,12).


# d. Overwrite the middle four elements of the resulting vector from (c) with the two recycled values -0.1 and -100, in that order.
