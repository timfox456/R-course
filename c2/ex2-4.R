# Exercise 2-4
 
# a. Create and store a vector that contains the following, in this order:
#    – A sequence of length 5 from 3 to 6 (inclusive)
#    – A twofold repetition of the vector c(2,-5.1,-33)
#     – Thevalue7+2 42


# b. Extract the first and last elements of your vector from (a), storing them as a new object.


# c. Store as a third object the values returned by omitting the first and last values of your vector from (a).


# d. Use only (b) and (c) to reconstruct (a).


# e. Overwrite (a) with the same values sorted from smallest to largest.


# f. Use the colon operator as an index vector to reverse the order of (e), and confirm this is identical to using sort on (e) with decreasing=TRUE.


# g. Create a vector from (c) that repeats the third element of (c) three times, the sixth element four times, and the last ele- ment once.


# h. Create a new vector as a copy of (e) by assigning (e) as is to a newly named object. 
#    Using this new copy of (e), overwrite the first, the fifth to the seventh (inclusive), 
#    and the last element with the values 99 to 95 (inclusive), respectively.
