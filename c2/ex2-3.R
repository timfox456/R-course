# Exercise 2-3

# a. Create and store a sequence of values from 5 to -11 that pro- gresses in steps of 0.3.

# b. Overwrite the object from (a) using the same sequence with the order reversed.

# c. Repeat the vector c(-1,3,-5,7,-9) twice, with each element repeated 10 times, and store the result. Display the result sorted from largest to smallest.

# d. Create and store a vector that contains, in any configuration, the following:
#    i. A sequence of integers from 6 to 12 (inclusive)
#    ii. A threefold repetition of the value 5.3
#    iii. The number -3
#    iv. A sequence of nine values starting at 102 and ending at the
#         number that is the total length of the vector created in (c)

# e. Confirm that the length of the vector created in (d) is 20.
