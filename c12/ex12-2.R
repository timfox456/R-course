# Ex 12-2

# a. Modify prog_test from Section 12.2.1 to include an ellipsis in its
# argument list, intended to take values for the additional argu- ments in
# txtProgressBar; name the new function prog_test_fancy. Time how long it takes
# a call to prog_test_fancy to execute. Set 50 as n, instruct the progress bar
# (through the ellipsis) to use style=3, and set the bar character to be "r".

# b. In Section 12.1.2, you defined a function named myfibvectorTRY (which
# itself calls myfibrec2 from Section 12.1.1) to return mul- tiple terms from
# the Fibonacci sequence based on a supplied “term vector” nvec. Write a new
# version of myfibvectorTRY that includes a progress bar of style=3 and a
# character of your choos- ing that increments at each pass of the internal for
# loop. Then, do the following:

# i. Use your new function to reproduce the results from the text where

nvec=c(3,2,7,0,9,13)

# ii. Time how long it takes to use your new function to return the first 35
# terms of the Fibonacci sequence. What do you notice, and what does this say
# about your recursive Fibonacci functions?

# c. Remain with the Fibonacci sequence. Write a stand-alone for loop that can
# compute, and store in a vector, the same first 35 terms as in (b)(ii). Time
# it. Which approach would you prefer?
