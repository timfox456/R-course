# Ex 25-2

# Ensure the scatterplot3d library has been loaded in your current R session.

# a. Turn your attention back to the diabetes data frame found in the faraway
# package (you first looked at these data in Section 21.5.2). Your goal is to
# produce a scatterplot3d plot of weight, hip, and waist measurements as per
# the following guidelines:

# – Hip, waist, and weight variables should correspond to the x-axis, y-axis,
# and z-axis, respectively; provide neat axis titles.

# – Use built-in functionality to ensure the 3D depth is high- lighted by
# color.

# – Choose two different point characters to reflect gender.

# – Place a simple legend referencing these two point characters and gender in
# the blank space in the upper-left area.

# b. Create a 3D scatterplot of the built-in airquality data, which you first
# met in Section 24.2.2, according to the following guidelines:

# – Create a copy of the data frame using na.omit to remove all rows that
# contain missing values and work with this copy.

# – Plot wind speed and solar radiation against the x- and y-axes,
# respectively, using the z-axis to plot temperature.

# – Apply vertical dotted lines reaching up from the x-y plane to each
# observation.

# – The data in airquality are comprised of measurements taken over five
# months, from May to September. Each plotted point should take on the
# corresponding pch value from 1 to 5 respective to the order of these five
# months.

# – With a vector of 50 colors generated from the built-in topo.colors palette,
# use the categorization approach to ensure each plotted point is colored
# according to its ozone value.

# – Set a legend to reference the five point types according to month.

# – Set a color legend (using functionality from the shape pack- age) to
# reference the ozone value accordingly.

# – Ensure the plot has neat axis, main, and legend titles.
