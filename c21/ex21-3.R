# Ex 21.3

# Return your attention to the cats data frame in package MASS. In the first
# few problems in Exercise 21.1, you fitted the main-effect-only model to
# predict the heart weights of domestic cats by total body weight and sex.

# a. Fit the model again, and this time include an interaction between the two
# predictors. Inspect the model summary. What do you notice in terms of the
# parameter estimates and their significance when compared to the earlier
# main-effect-only version?

# b. Produce a scatterplot of heart weight on body weight, using different
# point characters or colors to distinguish the obser- vations according to
# sex. Use abline to add two lines denoting the fitted model. How does this
# plot differ from the one in Exercise 21.1 (d)?

# c. Predict the heart weight of Tilmanâ€™s cat using the new model (remember
# that Sigma is a 3.4 kg female) accompanied by a 95 percent prediction
# interval. Compare it to the main-effects- only model from the earlier
# exercise.
