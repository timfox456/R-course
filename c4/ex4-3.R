# #x 4-3

# a. Store this vector of 10 values: foo <- c(7,5,6,1,2,10,8,3,8,2). Then, do the following:

# i. Extract the elements greater than or equal to 5, storing the result as bar.

# ii. Display the vector containing those elements from foo that

# remain after omitting all elements that are greater than or equal to 5.

# b. Use bar from (a)(i) to construct a 2 × 3 matrix called baz, filled in a row-wise fashion. Then, do the following:

# i. Replace any elements that are equal to 8 with the squared value of the element in row 1, column 2 of baz itself.

# ii. Confirm that all values in baz are now less than or equal to AND greater than 4.

# c. Create a 3 × 2 × 3 array called qux using the following vector of 18 values: c(10,5,1,4,7,4,3,3,1,3,4,3,1,7,8,3,7,3). Then, do the following:

# i. Identify the dimension-specific index positions of element that are either 3 OR 4.

# ii. Replace all elements in qux that are less than 3 OR greater than or equal to 7 with the value 100.

# d. Return to foo from (a). Use the vector c(F,T) to extract every second value from foo. In Section 4.1.4, you saw that in some situations, you can substitute 0 and 1 for TRUE and FALSE. Can you perform the same extraction from foo using the vector c(0,1)? Why or why not? What does R return in this case?
