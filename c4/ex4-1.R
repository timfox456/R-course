# Ex 4-1

# a. Store the following vector of 15 values as an object in your workspace: c(6,9,7,3,6,7,9,6,3,6,6,7,1,9,1). Identify the fol- lowing elements:

# i. Those equal to 6

# ii. Those greater than or equal to 6

# iii. Those less than 6 + 2

# iv. Those not equal to 6

# b. Create a new vector from the one used in (a) by deleting its first three elements. With this new vector, fill a 2 × 2 × 3 array. Examine the array for the following entries:
  # i. Those less than or equal to 6 divided by 2, plus 4
  # ii. Those less than or equal to 6 divided by 2, plus 4, after increasing every element in the array by 2

# c. Confirm the specific locations of elements equal to 0 in the 10 × 10 identity matrix I10 (see Section 3.3).

# d. Check whether any of the values of the logical arrays created in (b) are TRUE. If they are, check whether they are all TRUE.

# e. By extracting the diagonal elements of the logical matrix created in (c), use any to confirm there are no TRUE entries.
