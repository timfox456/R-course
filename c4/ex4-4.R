# Ex 4-4

# a. Re-create exactly the following output:
# "The quick brown fox
#       jumped over
#            the lazy dogs"



# b. Suppose you’ve stored the values num1 <- 4 and num2 <- 0.75.
# Write a line of R code that returns the following string:
    # [1] "The result of multiplying 4 by 0.75 is 3"
# Make sure your code produces a string with the correct multiplication result for any two numbers stored as num1 and num2.




# c. On my local machine, the directory for my work on this book is specified in R as "/Users/tdavies/Documents/RBook/". Imagine it is your machine—write a line of code that replaces tdavies in this string with your first initial and surname.



# d. In Section 4.2.4, you stored the following string:
    # R> bar <- "How much wood could a woodchuck chuck"


# i. Store a new string by gluing onto bar the words "if a woodchuck could chuck wood".

# ii. In the result of (i), replace all instances of wood with metal.



# e. Store the string "Two 6-packs for $12.99". Then do the following:

# i. Use a check for equality to confirm that the substring beginning with character 5 and ending with character 10 is "6-pack".

# ii. Make it a better deal by changing the price to $10.99.
