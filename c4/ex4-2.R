# Ex 4-2

# a. Store the vector c(7,1,7,10,5,9,10,3,10,8) as foo. Identify the elements greater than 5 OR equal to 2.


# b. Store the vector c(8,8,4,4,5,1,5,6,6,8) as bar. Identify the ele- ments less than or equal to 6 AND not equal to 4.


# c. Identify the elements that satisfy (a) in foo AND satisfy (b) in bar.


# d. Store a third vector called baz that is equal to the element-wise sum of foo and bar. Determine the following:


# i. The elements of baz greater than or equal to 14 but not
# equal to 15

# ii. The elements of the vector obtained via an element-wise
# division of baz by foo that are greater than 4 OR less than or equal to 2


# e. Confirm that using the long version in all of the preceding exercises performs only the first comparison (that is, the results each match the first entries of the previously obtained vectors).
