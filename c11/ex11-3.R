# Ex 11-3

# a. Given a list whose members are character string vectors of vary- ing
# lengths, use a disposable function with lapply to paste an exclamation mark
# onto the end of each element of each mem- ber, with an empty string as the
# separation character (note that the default behavior of paste when applied to
# character vectors is to perform the concatenation on each element). Execute
# your line of code on the list given by the following:

foo <-  list("a",c("b","c","d","e"),"f",c("g","h","i"))

# b. Write a recursive version of a function implementing the non-negative
# integer factorial operator (see Exercise 10.4 on page 203 for details of the
# factorial operator). The stopping rule should return the value 1 if the
# supplied integer is 0. Confirm that your function produces the same results
# as earlier.

# i. 5 factorial is 120.

# ii. 120 factorial is 479,001,600.

#iii. 0 factorial is 1.

# c. For this problem, I’ll introduce the geometric mean. The geometric mean is
# a particular measure of centrality, different from the more common arithmetic
# mean. Given n observations denoted x1, x2, . . ., xn, their geometric mean g ̄
# is computed as follows:

# jg = ( x 1 × x 2 × . . . × x n ) = *Yn ,i=1 x i +1/n -

# For example, to find the geometric mean of the data 4.3, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, calculate the following:

# g = (4.3 × 2.1 × 2.2 × 3.1)1/4 = 61.58460.25 = 2.8

# (This is rounded to 1 d.p.)

# Write a function named geolist that can search through a specified list and compute the geometric means of each member per the following guidelines:

# – Your function must define and use an internal helper func- tion that
# returns the geometric mean of a vector argument.

# – Assume the list can only have numeric vectors or numeric matrices as its
# members. Your function should contain an appropriate loop to inspect each
# member in turn.

# – If the member is a vector, compute the geometric mean of that
# vector,overwriting the member with the result, which should be a single
# number.

# – If the member is a matrix, use an implicit loop to compute the geometric
# mean of each row of the matrix, overwriting the member with the results.

# – The final list should be returned to the user.

# Now, as a quick test, check that your function matches the
# following two calls: i.
foo <- list(1:3,matrix(c(3.3,3.2,2.8,2.1,4.6,4.5,3.1,9.4),4,2),
            matrix(c(3.3,3.2,2.8,2.1,4.6,4.5,3.1,9.4),2,4))
geolist(foo)
