#(a)

# a. Write another Fibonacci sequence function, naming it myfib4. This function
# should provide an option to perform either the operations available in
# myfib2, where the sequence is simply printed to the console, or the
# operations in myfib3, where a vec- tor of the sequence is formally returned.
# Your function should take two arguments: the first, thresh, should define the
# limit of the sequence (just as in myfib2 or myfib3); the second, printme,
# should be a logical value. If TRUE, then myfib4 should just print; if FALSE,
# then myfib4 should return a vector. Confirm the correct results arise from
# the following calls:


# 10-4 factorial while loop
mynum.fac <- 1
while(mynum>1){
  mynum.fac <- mynum.fac*mynum
  mynum <- mynum-1
}
mynum.fac
## end code


#write the following:

myfib4 <- function(thresh,printme) {
  # write yoour code here

}



myfib4(thresh=150,printme=TRUE) - myfib4(1000000,T)
myfib4(150,FALSE)
myfib4(1000000,printme=F)

# Solution

myfib4 <- function(thresh,printme){
  if(printme){
    fib.a <- 1
    fib.b <- 1
    cat(fib.a,", ",fib.b,", ",sep="")
    repeat{
      temp <- fib.a+fib.b
      fib.a <- fib.b
      fib.b <- temp
      cat(fib.b,", ",sep="")
      if(fib.b>thresh){
        cat("BREAK NOW...")
        break
      }
    }
  } else {
    fibseq <- c(1,1)
    counter <- 2
    repeat{
      fibseq <- c(fibseq,fibseq[counter-1]+fibseq[counter])
      counter <- counter+1
      if(fibseq[counter]>thresh){
        break
      }
    }
    return(fibseq)
  }
}
myfib4(thresh=150,printme=TRUE)
myfib4(1000000,T)
myfib4(150,FALSE)
myfib4(1000000,printme=F)

# b. In Exercise 10.4 on page 203, you were tasked with writing a while loop to
# perform integer factorial calculations.

# i. Using your factorial while loop (or writing one if you didnâ€™t do so
# earlier), write your own R function, myfac, to compute the factorial of an
# integer argument int (you may assume int will always be supplied as a
# non-negative integer). Perform a quick test of the function by computing 5
# factorial, which is 120; 12 factorial, which is 479,001,600; and 0 factorial,
# which is 1.

myfac <- function(int){
  result <- 1
  while(int>1){
    result <- result*int
    int <- int-1
  }
  return(result)
}
myfac(5)
myfac(12)
myfac(0)

# ii. Write another version of your factorial function, naming it myfac2. This
# time, you may still assume int will be supplied as an integer but not that it
# will be non-negative. If negative, the function should return NaN. Test
# myfac2 on the same three values as previously, but also try using int=-6.
myfac2 <- function(int){
  if(int<0){
    return(NaN)
  }
  result <- 1
  while(int>1){
    result <- result*int
    int <- int-1
  }
  return(result)
}
myfac2(5)
myfac2(12)
myfac2(0)
myfac2(-6)
