# In the package MASS you’ll find the data set anorexia, which contains data on
# pre- and post-treatment weights (in pounds) of 72 young women suffering from
# the disease, obtained from Hand et al. (1994). One group of women is the
# control group (in other words, no inter- vention), and the other two groups
# are the cognitive behavioral program and family support intervention program
# groups. Load the library and ensure you can access the data frame and
# understand its contents. Let μd denote the mean difference in weight,
# computed as (post-weight − pre-weight).

# a. Regardless of which treatment group the participants fall into, conduct
# and conclude an appropriate hypothesis test with α = 0.05 for the entire set
# of weights for the following hypotheses:

# H0 : μd = 0 
# HA : μd > 0

# b. Next, conduct three separate hypothesis tests using the same defined
# hypotheses, based on which treatment group the partici- pants fall into. What
# do you notice?

# Another ready-to-use data set in R is PlantGrowth (Dobson, 1983), which
# records a continuous measure of the yields of a certain plant, looking at the
# potential effect of two supplements administered during growth to increase
# the yield when compared to a control group with no supplement.

# c. Set up hypotheses to test whether the mean yield for the control group is
# less than the mean yield from a plant given either of the treatments.
# Determine whether this test should proceed using a pooled estimate of the
# variance or whether Welch’s t-test would be more appropriate.

# d. Conduct the test and make a conclusion (assuming normality of the raw
# observations).
