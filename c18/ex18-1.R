# Ex 18.1

 # Adult domestic cats of a certain breed are said to have an average weight of
# 3.5 kilograms. A feline enthusiast disagrees and collects a sample of 73
# weights of cats of this breed. From her sample, she calculates a mean of 3.97
# kilograms and a standard deviation of 2.21 kilograms. Perform a hypothesis
# test to test her claim that the true mean weight μ is not 3.5 kilograms by
# setting up the appropriate hypothesis, carrying out the analysis, and
# interpret- ing the p-value (assume the significance level is α = 0.05).

# b. Suppose it was previously believed that the mean magnitude of seismic
# events off the coast of Fiji is 4.3 on the Richter scale. Use the data in the
# mag variable of the ready-to-use quakes data set, providing 1,000 sampled
# seismic events in that area, to test the claim that the true mean magnitude
# is in fact greater than 4.3. Set up appropriate hypotheses, use t.test
# (conduct the test at a significance level of α = 0.01), and draw a
# conclusion.

# c. Manually compute a two-sided confidence interval for the true mean of (b).
