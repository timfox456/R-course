# Consider the following data:

# These figures provide the depths (in centimeters) at which important
# archaeological finds were made at four sites in New Mex- ico (see Woosley and
# Mcintyre, 1996). Store these data in your R workspace, with one vector
# containing depth and the other vector containing the site of each
# observation.

# a. Produce side-by-side boxplots of the depths split by group, and use
# additional points to mark the locations of the sample means.

# b. Assuming independence, execute diagnostic checks for normal- ity and
# equality of variances.

# c. Perform and conclude a one-way ANOVA test for evidence of a difference
# between the means. In Section 14.4, you looked at the data set providing
# measurements on petal and sepal sizes for three species of iris flowers. This
# is avail- able in R as iris. d. Based on diagnostic checks for normality and
# equality of vari- ances, decide which of the four outcome measurements (sepal
# length/width and petal length/width) would be suitable for ANOVA (using the
# species as the group variable).

# e. Carry out one-way ANOVA for any suitable measurement variables.
