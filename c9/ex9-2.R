# a. Use positional matching with seq to create a sequence of values between −4
# and 4 that progresses in steps of 0.2.

# b. In each of the following lines of code, identify which style of argument
# matching is being used: exact, partial, positional, or mixed. If mixed,
# identify which arguments are specified in each style.

# i. array(8:1,dim=c(2,2,2))

# ii. rep(1:2,3)

# iii. seq(from=10,to=8,length=5)

# iv. sort(decreasing=T,x=c(2,1,1,2,0.3,3,1.3)) v. which(matrix(c(T,F,T,T),2,2))

# vi. which(matrix(c(T,F,T,T),2,2),a=T)

# c. Suppose you explicitly ran the plotting function plot.default and supplied
# values to arguments tagged type, pch, xlab, ylab, lwd, lty, and col. Use the
# function documentation to determine which of these arguments fall under the
# umbrella of the ellipsis.
