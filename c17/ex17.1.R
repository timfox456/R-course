## Exercise 17.1


# A teacher wants to test all of the 10th-grade students at his school to gauge
# their basic mathematical understanding, but the photocopier breaks after
# making only six copies of the test. With no other choice, he chooses six
# students at random to take the test. Their results, recorded as a score out
# of 65, have a sample mean of 41.1. The standard deviation of the marks of
# this test is known to be 11.3.

# a. Find the standard error associated with the mean test score.

# b. Assuming the scores themselves are normally distributed, evalu- ate the
# probability that the mean score lies between 45 and 55 if the teacher took
# another sample of the same size.

# c. A student who gets less than half the questions correct receives a failing
# grade (F). Find the probability that the average score is an F based on
# another sample of the same size.

# A marketing company wants to find out which of two energy drinks teenagers
# prefer—drink A or drink B. It surveys 140 teens, and the results indicate
# that only 35 percent prefer drink A.

# d. Use a quick check to decide whether it is valid to use the nor- mal
# distribution to represent the sampling distribution of this proportion.

# e. What is the probability that in another sample of the same size, the
# proportion of teenagers who prefer drink A is greater than 0.4?

# f. Find the two values of this sampling distribution that identify the central 80 percent of values of the proportion of interest.

#In Section 16.2.4, the time between cars passing an individual’s location was
#modeled using an exponential distribution. Say that on the other side of town,
#her friend is curious about a similar problem. Standing outside her house, she
#records 63 individual times between cars passing. These sampled times have a
#mean of x ̄ = 37.8 seconds with a standard deviation of s = 34.51 seconds.
