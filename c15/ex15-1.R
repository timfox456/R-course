# Ex 15-1

# You have a standard deck of 52 playing cards. There are two colors (black and
# red) and four suits (spades are black, clubs are black, hearts are red, and
# diamonds are red). Each suit has 13 cards, in which there is an ace, numbered
# cards from 2 to 10, and three face cards (jack, queen, and king).

# a. You randomly draw and then replace a card. What’s the probabil- ity it’s
# an ace? What’s the probability it’s the 4 of spades?

# b. You randomly draw a card, and after replacing it, you draw another. Let A
# be the event that the card is a club; let B be the event that the card is
# red. What is Pr(A|B)? That is, what is the probability the second card is a
# club, given the first one was a red card? Are the two events independent?

# c. Repeat (b), this time assuming that when the first (club) card is drawn,
# it is not replaced. Would this change your answer to (b) in terms of
# independence?

# d. Let Cbe the event a card is a facecard , and let  D be the event a card is
# black. You draw a single card. Evaluate Pr(C ∩ D). Are the two events
# mutually exclusive?
