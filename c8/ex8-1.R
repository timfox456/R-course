# 8.1

# a.
# In R’s built-in datasets library is the data frame quakes. Make sure you can
# access this object and view the corresponding help file to get an idea of
# what this data represents. Then, do the following: 

# i. Select only those records that correspond to a magnitude (mag) of greater
# than or equal to 5 and write them to a table-format file called q5.txt in an
# existing folder on your machine. Use a delimiting character of ! and do not
# include any row names.


# ii. Read the file back into your R workspace, naming the object q5.dframe.

# b. Originally the lab had you install the package car, however that is problematic
# so instead of doing that, let us load the Duncan file duncan.csv. We will load it into
# a data frame called Duncan, which
# provides historical data on perceived job prestige in 1950. Install the car
# package and access the Duncan data set and its help file. Then, do the
# following:

Duncan = read.csv("duncan.csv")

# i. Write R code that will plot education on the x-axis and income on the
# y-axis, with both x- and y-axis limits fixed to be [0,100].

# Provide appropriate axis labels. For jobs with a prestige value of less than
# or equal to 80, use a black ◦ as the point character. For jobs with prestige
# greater than 80, use a blue •.

# ii. Add a legend explaining the difference between the two types of points
# and then save a 500 × 500 pixel .png file of the image.

# c. Create a list called exer that contains the three data sets quakes,
# q5.dframe, and Duncan. Then, do the following:

# i. Write the list object directly to disk, calling it Exercise8-1.txt.
# Briefly inspect the contents of the file in a text editor.

# ii. Read Exercise8-1.txt back into your workspace; call the resulting object
# list.of.dataframes. Check that list.of.dataframes does indeed
# contain the three data frame objects.


# d. In Section 7.4.3, you created a ggplot2 graphic of 20 observations
# displayed as the bottom image of Figure 7-11 on page 144. Use ggsave to save
# a copy of this plot as a .tiff file.
