
# Ex 3-1


# a. Construct and store a 4 × 2 matrix that’s filled row-wise with the values 4.3, 3.1, 8.2, 8.2, 3.2, 0.9, 1.6, and 6.5, in that order.


# b. Confirm the dimensions of the matrix from (a) are 3 × 2 if you remove any one row.


# c. Overwrite the second column of the matrix from (a) with that same column sorted from smallest to largest.


# d. What does R return if you delete the fourth row and the first col- umn from (c)? Use matrix to ensure the result is a single-column matrix, rather than a vector.


# e. Store the bottom four elements of (c) as a new 2 × 2 matrix.


# f. Overwrite, in this order, the elements of (c) at positions (4,2), (1,2), (4,1), and (1,1) with −12 of the two values on the diagonal of (e).
