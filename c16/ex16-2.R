# Ex 16-2

# Every Saturday, at the same time, an individual stands by the side of a road
# and tallies the number of cars going by within a 120-minute window. Based on
# previous knowledge, she believes that the mean number of cars going by during
# this time is exactly 107. Let X repre- sent the appropriate Poisson random
# variable of the number of cars passing her position in each Saturday session.

# a. What is the probability that more than 100 cars pass her on any given
# Saturday?

# b. Determine the probability that no cars pass.

# c. Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values 60 <= x <= 150

# d. Simulate 260 results from this distribution (about 5 years of weekly
# Saturday morning session). Plot the simulated results using hist, use 
# xlim to set the horizontal limits from 60 to 150. Compare your histogram
# to the shape of your mass function from part (c).
