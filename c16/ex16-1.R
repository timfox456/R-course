# Ex 16.1

# A forested nature reserve has 13 bird-viewing platforms scattered throughout
# a large block of land. The naturalists claim that at any point in time, there
# is a 75 percent chance of seeing birds at each platform. Suppose you walk
# through the reserve and visit every platform. If you assume that all relevant
# conditions are sat- isfied, let X be a binomial random variable representing
# the total number of platforms at which you see birds.

# a. Visualize the probability mass function of the binomial distribu- tion of interest.

# b. What is the probability you see birds at all sites?

# c. What is the probability you see birds at more than 9 platforms?

# d. What is the probability of seeing birds at between 8 and 11 platforms (inclusive)? Confirm your answer by using only the d-function and then again using only the p-function.

# e. Say that, before your visit, you decide that if you see birds at fewer than 9 sites, you’ll make a scene and demand your entry fee back. What’s the probability of your embarrassing yourself in this way?

# f. Simulate realizations of X that represent 10 different visits to the
# reserve; store your resulting vector as an object.

# g. Compute the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of interest.
